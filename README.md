# DifferentVPCs
Experiment to deploy infrastructure in different VPCs. Use terraform to build repeatable environments in different regions and eventually different cloud service providers. 
#
#
Experiment to use terraform workspaces to create infrastructure in us-east-1 and eu-west-1. Workspaces created for each region and also created eu-west-1.tfvars and us-east-1.tfvars.
```
terraform workspace new us-east-1
terraform workspace new eu-west-1
```
Then create resources based on .tfvars files:
```
terraform workspace select us-east-1
terraform apply -var-file us-east-1.tfvars
terraform workspace select eu-west-1
terraform apply -var-file eu-west-1.tfvars
```
Noted that if the region is not set or is set incorrectly then this doesnâ€™t work. Having the region set in an AWS profile can confuse things if the var file is not specified. 

Sample contents of *.tfvars file

```
region = "us-east-1"
vpc_cidr_block = "10.2.0.0/16"
public_subnet_cidr_blocks = ["10.2.1.0/24", "10.2.3.0/24"]
private_subnet_cidr_blocks = ["10.2.2.0/24", "10.2.4.0/24"]
availability_zones = ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b"]
instance-ami = "ami-007855ac798b5175e"
key-pair = "******"
```
