# DifferentVPCs
Experiment to deploy infrastructure in different VPCs.
#
#
Experiment to use terraform workspaces to create infrastructure in us-east-1 and eu-west-1. Workspaces created for each region and also created eu-west-1.tfvars and us-east-1.tfvars.
```
terraform workspace new us-east-1
terraform workspace new eu-west-1
``
Then create resources based on .tfvars files:
```
terraform workspace select us-east-1
terraform apply -var-file us-east-1.tfvars
terraform workspace select eu-west-1
terraform apply -var-file eu-west-1.tfvars
```
Noted that if the region is not set or is set incorrectly then this doesnâ€™t work. Having the region set in an AWS profile can confuse things if the var file is not specified.
